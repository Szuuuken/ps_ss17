# Assignment 2
## CNF test suite

This small test program will test `graph.cnf` against the example test cases provided in the task's specification.

The file `graph.cnf` must be located in the same directory as `test.sh`.

__Note:__ `test.sh` will _freely create and remove_ files by the naming scheme `testcase_*.cnf`.

### Usage:

```
VERBOSE=true ./test.sh
```

or

```
./test.sh
```
